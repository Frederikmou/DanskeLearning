    <p class="my-text">MyGrowth: A page dedicated to your
        own reflection as part of Danske Bank.
        This is your own personal area, and is
        created to make it easier for you to
        reflect on the past month. When it’s
        time for your annual Check-In with your
        closest leader, you have something to
        inspire the conversation</p>
